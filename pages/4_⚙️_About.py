        A 2D Helmert transformation is used to transform coordinates from one rectangular source coordinate system to another target coordinate system.
        It is also known as 4 parameter similarity transformation.  
        The 2D Helmert transformation is the most common 2D transformation method in surveying. The shape of objects is not distorted.  
        The transformation consists of 4 parameters:
            
        $Y_0:$&ensp;Translation (shift) from source into target system in the y-axis direction   
        $X_0:$ Translation (shift) from source into target system in the x-axis direction  
        $k:$ Scale  
        $Œ∏:$ Rotation

        - **Upload Coordinates:** The user can upload files with the coordinates in the source
          and target system. The files must have at least three columns with column 1 for
           the point name, column 2 for the East coordinate and column 3 for the North coordinate.
           The files may have one header row (i.e. Name/East/North or Point/x/y). If no text header 
           row is detected the default header is used (Name/y/x). If nothing is uploaded example
           coordinates are used.
        - **Select Common Points:** Common points are identified by the point name.
           At first all common points are selected and shown with their residuals.
          The user can unselect or select points but at least 2 common points need to be selected.
          The transformation parameters are re-calculated after every change in the selection of
           common points.
        - **Download Transformed Points:**  The coordinates that were uploaded as source
           coordinates are transformed with the calculated transformation parameters.  
          The transformed coordinates can be downloaded as csv file.
           A transformation report can be downloaded as txt file.
